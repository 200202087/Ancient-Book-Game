# Ancient Book Game

## Overview

**Ancient Book**, a unique 2D game that combines traditional game design with cutting-edge AI technology. In this project, we utilized Stable Diffusion AI to generate pixelart character sprites, enhancing the visual appeal and uniqueness of the game.

## Game Description

Ancient Book immerses players in a mystical world where they must use their wits and reflexes to survive. The game features a distinctive combat system based on writing spells quickly and accurately. Players must read their spellbook to understand which spells are most effective against specific enemies and then cast them as quickly as possible within the given time limit.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Characters**: All character sprites were generated using Stable Diffusion AI, ensuring high-quality and unique designs.
- **Innovative Combat System**: Engage in battles where success depends on your ability to quickly and accurately write spells. Each enemy is vulnerable to one of your three spells, and you must decipher which one to use from the spellbook.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Players must read and understand the spell descriptions to determine the most effective spell against each enemy type.
- **Engaging Experience**: The combination of AI-generated assets and unique gameplay mechanics offers an immersive and challenging experience.
